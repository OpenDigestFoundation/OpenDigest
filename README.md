# What is this repo for?
This is a paper reading repository for you to quickly catch up with the latest trends in your research field.

# What are the problems and opportunities of existing work?
* I need an open community for paper reading and digesting, but I cannot find one anywhere.
* I want to stay updated on the latest research.
* I've noticed a few YouTubers doing 2-hour-long, in-depth analyses of important papers. It's good, but it has the following three problems:
  * The effort required is significant.
  * It's too lengthy to follow regularly. I just want to keep up with the trends. If I find a paper interesting, I can read it myself later (or not).
  * The perspective is limited to one person. We need more opinions from researchers in similar fields.

# Our Mission
* Build a paper reading community where:
  * Beginner researchers can keep up with the latest research trends.
  * Expert researchers can share their opinions.
  * Authors can increase the exposure of their papers.
  * Accelerate global research progress by completing the missing pieces of beginner researchers' self-education.

# Key Design Idea
* Generate a quick paper digest draft of a new paper (by AI).
* Experts can contribute and edit this draft by submitting PRs (also a good way to help researchers get familiar with collaboration workflows on Github).
* Other experts can review contributions by their peers and approve PRs.
* Learners can ask questions by creating issues.
* Learners can request new paper digests.
* Learners can donate to this project for AI LLM token consumption.
